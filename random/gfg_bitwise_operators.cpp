}/*In C, following 6 operators are bitwise operators (work at bit-level)

& (bitwise AND) Takes two numbers as operand and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

| (bitwise OR) Takes two numbers as operand and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 any of the two bits is 1.

^ (bitwise XOR) Takes two numbers as operand and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

<< (left shift) Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

>> (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

~ (bitwise NOT) Takes one number and inverts all bits of it*/
